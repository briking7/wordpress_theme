# WordPress Theme For Basic WooCommerce Shop Website
Wordpress theme for a college project incorporating basic WooCommerce configuration, built using a Starter WordPress Theme based on Bones and Bootstrap 3.

This branding, website design and development project was aimed at creating a consistent brand presence through developing a customized WordPress child theme for educational purposes. I developed the theme to be compatible with WooCommerce; the home page utilizes fields accessible through the WordPress interface for user creativity and variability.

Features:
* Built From Brew Starter Theme Template (http://danvswild.com/brew)
* LESS
* Bootstrap 3
* Bones
* Basic WooCommerce Compatibility

How I began with using Brew:
1. download zip and upload as wordpress theme.
2. set variables at /less/custom-variables.less
3. add customize and add new LESS files according to theme needs


To do before v2.0:
* Update page comments for code contributions
* Look in to WooCommerce page template customization further
* Clean up WordPress templates/files
